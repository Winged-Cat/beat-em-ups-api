    "about": "64th Street: A Detective Story is a gumshoe-themed beat 'em up from Jaleco. It's claim to fame is the ability to throw enemies into the background, which breaks walls and reveals items. Besides that, it follows closely in the footsteps of Final Fight.",
    "trivia": "64th Street: A Detective Story is the first brawler from Jaleco. They would go on to develop the Rushing Beat trilogy on SNES, which has similar Final Fight-style gameplay with a few extra gimmicks.One of the items in this game is the ghost from Avenging Spirit, another arcade game from Jaleco. You play as a recently deceased youth who avenges himself by possessing enemies.To unlock Very Easy and Mania difficulties, highlight the options menu, hold A + B on player 2's controller, hold C on player 1's controller, and press start. You can also now increase the number of lives to 9. To play as the same character in co-op, hold down-right + B on controller 1, left + A on controller 2, press C on controller 2, and then finally pick 2-player mode.",

    "trivia": "Asterix is based off of the internationally beloved comic series by Rene Goscinny and Albert Uderzo. It's about Gauls (medieval French tribesman) who fight against Roman occupation by imbibing power potions brewed by a sage.The names in this series are all puns. Asterix is the * symbol, which signifies a \"wildcard\", Obelix means \"obelisk\", a giant rock, and Getafix is obvious.",

This game is oozing personality. However, the combat's too simple for my taste and the music's way below Konami standards. The slow pace and small enemy waves make the combat tedious.",

However, its combat is super sloppy and definitely qualifies as a button-masher. Its CGI look was competent for the time but now looks really dated. Only casual gamers and Batman fans should check this out.",

It plays a lot more like a 'Toads game than Double Dragon, with a strong emphasis on vehicle and platforming sections over combat. However, its difficulty is far more tame. The Game Boy port is remarkably similar to the NES version (including all stages) yet it lacks two player support.\n",

On the positive side, it has huge sprites, competent gameplay, and bizarre enemies. There are also charged projectiles for a slight change of pace. The music is annoying at best and grating at worst.",

    "trivia": "The US version actually has the full Japanese version as a hidden bonus. Press X,A,B,Y repeatedly when the Jaleco logo appears. You'll come to a screen with garbled graphics. Press down twice and then start. Finally, leave the menu and you're now playing Rushing Beat Ran instead of Brawl Brothers! The only difference between the actual Japanese version is that Slash (aka Douglas Bild) is still black.This game, Rival Turf!, and The Peace Keepers are all actually part of the same series (Rushing Beat) in Japan. For some reason, the localization team treated each release as a separate game and changed the names of the characters.",

Its combat is supposed to be built around alternating two attack buttons to pull off impressive combos, although it doesn't really matter which one you pick so it's basically a button-masher. The enemies are almost all pushovers and do little besides block. The graphics at least feature huge sprites, but are otherwise unremarkable.",

Although Renegade came out first, Double Dragon was the first internationally successful brawler. Its unprecedented co-op gameplay, expansive movesets, and iconic soundtrack allowed it to dominate the arcade beat 'em up scene for several years and solidify its status as a cultural phenomenon. To this day it remains one of the most widely recognized brawlers.\n",
    "trivia": "As of 2014, Double Dragon has been ported to over 20 platforms, ranging from old computers like ZX Spectrum to Android.A Double Dragon live action movie was released in 1994. It was critically panned and followed the game's story and characters only very loosely.Technōs attempted to convert Double Dragon to a fighting game, twice. There's Double Dragon on the Neo Geo and Double Dragon V: Shadow Falls on the SNES. There's also a Neo Geo fighting game called Rage of the Dragons which was supposed to be a DD fighting game but got the license dropped during development.For some reason, thrown items like crates and barrels make the game lag considerably. Try to throw them offscreen to increase the framerate.",

Despite its huge (although wildly imbalanced) moveset, stiff challenge, and extremely iconic OST, this game is dragged down by a single glaring flaw: it lags constantly. Whenever there are too many enemies onscreen, or just a single barrel, the action slows down to an unbearable crawl.",

There's some obnoxious platforming stuff but it's not hard to memorize and master. The soundtrack is superb.",

Even when abusing that, the gameplay is still extremely sloppy yet brutal. The enemy variety is nearly non-existent. Thankfully, bosses are somewhat manageable. The graphics and music are not great.",

    "overallReview": "Double Dragon II on the PC Engine is a decent port of the NES version. It maintains that game's combat, including the huge selection of grab-attacks. It eliminates a lot of the platforming segments as well. Its graphics are a little better than average, but unfortunately the new soundtrack kinda sucks. It also has some new anime-style custscenes.",

Stages seem to drag on because even basic foes have a lot of health. The graphics and sound are only average. On the plus side, you can switch between three unique fighters at will.",

Its combat is an interesting and satisfying mixture of charge-attacks and ammo-based projectiles. Thanks to the large waves of small enemies, the game can get surprisingly hectic. Unfortunately, no co-op.",

Due to the fact that it was an early game for the console and cartridge space was limited, Capcom had to make three serious cuts: Guy was completely removed, as was the Industrial Area stage, and it's a single-player only game. Furthermore, there are only three simultaneous enemies at once. Despite that, it's still Final Fight, and it has a ton of personality, memorable enemies, and satisfying gameplay.\n",
    "trivia": "For the US version, Poison and Roxy were changed to dudes (Sid and Billy) because Nintendo didn't want to see violence towards women on their system. They didn't care that Poison and perhaps Roxy are actually dudes.This game was ported to the GBA as Final Fight One. It restores the missing stage, Guy, and has as many onscreen enemies as the arcade version.",

Obviously, Guy being removed sucks and the fact you only fight three enemies at a time seems like the kiss of death for this port. However, it still has the original's graphics, music, and ridiculous style, even if the gameplay is only a semblance of its former self. It's not that easy either.",

    "about": "\n\nGolden Axe created the hack n' slash sub-genre of brawlers. Its weapons-based combat, screen-clearing magic attacks, mountable creatures, and barbarian aesthetic made it one of Sega's most successful early franchises. It's also notable for its short playtime, casual difficulty, and unique scoring system.\n",
    "trivia": "Golden Axe was developed by the same team as Altered Beast. Both games share the Chicken-Leg enemy.The characters in Streets of Rage II are named similarly to Golden Axe's fighters. Compare Axel Stone to Ax=Battler, Blaze Fielding to Tyris Flare, and Max Thunder to Gilius Thunderhead.Golden Axe uses scream samples from the following films: Commando, Rambo: First Blood, Conan the Barbarian, and An American Werewolf in London.Golden Axe uses a unique \"Strength\" system rather than a traditional score. It's calculated as follows:\nStrength = ((0.5 + 0.5L) * E * A) * M. L is the current level you're on (1-5). E is for Enemy. Normal enemies count as 1, bosses are 2, and Death=adder is 8. A is for the attack you kill the enemy with. Banging the top of their head followed by a kick is 3, a normal kick or throw is 2, and anything else is 1. Finally, this is multiplied by M, your Magic Multiplier (see below.) At the end of the game, your Strength for all kills is aggregated and then divided by the number of times you died to calculate your final score.It is possible to increase your Strength by skillfully using magic. After you kill an enemy, every time you hit them with magic afterwards multiplies your Strength. If you line up a row of Pots and quickly use magic before the enemy hits the ground, you can achieve ridiculously high Strength scores.",

The world design is fairly bland but at least there are giant pink chickens to liven things up. The music is extremely well-composed and fits the tone perfectly.",

There are a ton of moves but unfortunately you can spam the best ones to ruin the challenge. It looks really ugly but at least the music's pretty good. It can really drag on near the end and it's really long.",

You rarely fight more than two enemies at once, yet fighting them is still an exercise in tedium. Five minutes of this game feels like an hour in the worst way possible.",

This is a game that you play repeatedly to memorize each stage. The gun-based boss battles are a cool change of pace but are generally a lot easier than the rest of the game. The enemy variety is poor.",

    "about": "\n\nKnights of the Round is a hack 'n' slash brawler from Capcom. It innovates in no less than four ways: it introduced a blocking mechanic that grants temporary invincibility, your character gains experience and changes appearance, items can be broken up and shared, and killing the same type of enemy consecutively grants a bonus. It also has a one-of-a-kind melodic medieval soundtrack.\n",
    "trivia": "Knights of the Round is the least similar to Final Fight out of all Capcom's brawlers. Besides a death-blow attack, Knights of the Round distances itself from Capcom's genre-dominating classic by focusing on weapons-based combat against relatively few enemies and emphasizing advanced techniques.Every large item can be broken up into smaller pieces by attacking it. With the exception of the Salad, which can possibly go down in value, every other item grants more total points when broken apart. Do your best to attack every item and only grab it right away if it's about to disappear.Knights of the Round is the only brawler (and one of the few games, ever) where you change appearance as you level up. It's also the only arcade brawler with an experience system, although a small handful of console brawlers (most notably Double Dragon on NES) also use XP.Knights of the Round has a unique combo system. Killing the same type of enemy in a row multiplies the score by up to x4. Using this is key to leveling up all the way. In multiplayer games, everybody shares the same combo counter. Therefore, it's important to talk with your friends and try to kill enemies in the best order possible. Of course, this is hard if your friends suck at games.Knights of the Round has a unique blocking system that is unlike any other game. When you block an enemy's attack, you actually gain a few seconds of complete invincibility that you can use to punish the enemy with powerful attacks. Although blocking drags down almost every other brawler it's present in (see River City Ransom or Guardian Heroes), Knights of the Round does it right.",

Although the gameplay is solid, most enemies are fought in the same way and the combat feels sort of off. Also, the music is sparse and not that great. However, its insane style compensates for this.",

Both games feature combat against two opponents at once and have an experience system where each move grants different XP and you gain new moves by leveling up.Mighty Final Fight is available on the GBA as part of Capcom Mini-Mix alongside Bionic Commando and Strider.",

    "overallReview": "Kunio is the best. It'll undoubtedly turn off most players at first, but once you learn how its combat works it's pure joy. The unbelievably huge movesets were way ahead of its time, and the face-punch attack is infinitely satisfying. The graphics are awful, but the music's super catchy and memorable. The labyrinth is dubious, though.",

Its combat engine is actually more similar to the very first Kunio game (i.e. Renegade) than Downtown Special (aka River City Ransom.) It also adds a crouch move that can be followed up with a mighty spinning uppercut as well as a gut-jumping attack. It features three difficulty settings and link cable support for two-player gameplay.\n",
    "trivia": "This game was re-worked into Double Dragon II on the Game Boy (it has different graphics and music) for US audiences.This is the only Kunio game with stun-based grabs, a gut-jump attack, a crouch move, or a flying uppercut.",

I personally like DD2's music better, but this isn't much worse. It's a great game to beat in one sitting, although the combat could use some work because uppercuts dominate the gameplay.",

If you can stomach the gameplay the art style could be worth it if you're into gross-out stuff.",

It's largely a Guardian Heroes rip-off, as it features the same three-lane system and fighting game-style advanced techniques. However, it carves out its own niche with a futuristic setting, emphasis on projectiles, and an energy bar used for super attacks that fills up when you attack. It also has a Mega Man-esque stage select system.\n",
    "trivia": "This is the only other game to adopt Guardian Heroes' three-lane gimmick. Even Advance Guardian Heroes abandoned the system.This is one of few brawlers that features a completely robotic character. Some others are Cosmo Police Galivan II: Arrow of Justice on the Super Famicom and Alien Storm for arcade.",

    "about": "\n\nSonic Blast Man is a groundbreaking single player SNES-exclusive brawler. Its gameplay emphasizes stunning enemies by knocking them down to critical health and keeping them onscreen so you can unleash a powerful Tornado Throw. Its steep challenge is defined by powerful enemies that demand mastery of brawler fundamentals to defeat. Its graphics feature gigantic sprites and several Mode 7 effects. Its ultra-catchy soundtrack is composed by Taito's legendary house band, Zuntata.\n",
    "trivia": "The original Sonic Blast Man for the arcades wasn't actually a beat 'em up. It was basically a punching bag attached to a screen that you have to hit as hard as humanly possible. However, these were kept for this release as the Hit Stages between levels. Of course, there's no punching bag, so you have to rotate the D-pad instead.Like the US localization of Final Fight before it, female enemies in this game were changed to males to appease Nintendo of America's censorship policies.There's also Sonic Blast Man II on SNES, but it's completely different. It abandons the innovative gameplay for something far more generic and has way smaller sprites, but at least it's two-player.",

The sprites are huge, the pixel art is excellent, and the music is pure Zuntata goodness. This is the best single-player brawler ever made in my opinion.",

    "overallReview": "Spider-Man is like a lame Konami game from Sega. Sure, it's a licensed brawler with good graphics and simple gameplay. But Spider-Man's combat is flat, stiff, and boring whereas Konami games are usually exciting despite the simplicity. The action-platformer stages are interesting but not really what I'm looking for in a brawler, especially for arcade.",

    "trivia": "Streets of Rage innovated the genre by adding the vault technique, which allows you to transition from a front to a back grab and unleash suplexes at will.The cover art features a Jason Voorhees-style enemy that isn't actually in the game. However, he would later make an appearance in Streets of Rage Remake on the PC.The cop car in the screen-clearing special attack animation is from another Sega game, Cyber Police E-SWAT. Additionally, the original title for this game was going to be Dragon SWAT or D-SWAT.Streets was developed by several members from Team Shinobi, who of course worked on the Shinobi series. It features the same font and several sound effects from Return of Shinobi on the Genesis.Streets of Rage is available on several modern platforms, including PSN, Xbox Live, Steam, Wii, 3DS, and even mobile phones. It's also part of the 6-Pak compilation on Sega Genesis along with Golden Axe.Streets of Rage was playable in arcades on Sega's Mega-Tech hardware, which was basically just a Genesis in an arcade cabinet.If you wait around on the character select screen long enough, Blaze will wink at you.Check out http://www.soronline.net for more Streets info!",

It improves upon its predecessor across the board with deeper combat, more diverse characters, elaborate multi-part stages, and an even greater challenge. Its soundtrack is the stuff of legend.\n",
    "trivia": "In the Japanese box art, Axel strongly resembles Jean-Claude Van Damme and Mr. X looks quite a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger.There are a few hidden tracks in the sound test that aren't present in the actual game. Track 9 is a hot little ditty entitled Little Money Avenue. It was originally intended for a bonus stage but that idea was scrapped during development.Yuzo Koshiro voices all the characters in this game. For Blaze, he sped up the recording to make it sound female.In the Japanese version, Blaze's jump kick has a different animation showing her panties. This was changed for obvious reasons in the US and PAL releases.The US version is known as Streets of Rage 2, in PAL regions it's Streets of Rage II, and in Japan it's known as Bare Knuckle II: The Requiem of the Deadly Battle.Streets of Rage II is available on a ton of platforms, including Game Gear, Sega Master System, PSN, Xbox Live, Wii, Steam, and even mobile phones.The \"It's like Boo!\" signs in the stadium stage are likely a reference to how the fat guy enemies have a similar flying bellyflop attack to the character Boo from the Dragonball Z series.Many enemy names are references to anime characters, mostly from Berserk and Fist of the North Star. Some examples are Caska, Griphis, Heart, and Vehelits.Konami seemed to rip-off Blaze's design for April O'Neil in TMNT: Tournament Fighters on the Genesis. The only thing distinguishing April are blue gloves and a bandanna.In the beta, Axel's stationary special attack was a spinning hurricane kick rather than his signature Dragon Wing. Also, Max's walk animation was more ape-like.When you enter a new area or defeat a wave on an elevator section, your health is restored slightly. Lower difficulties restore more health than challenging ones. This feature was likely implemented to give the player a greater incentive to use special attacks, which cost health. Therefore, you basically get one free special per area because it's going to be restored soon anyway.",

    "about": "\n\nStreets of Rage 3 is the explosive final chapter to Sega's outstanding console brawler franchise. It improves upon Streets 2 with star-based dash attacks, vertical rolling, rechargeable specials, semi-branching stages, tons of new enemies, and much faster gameplay. It also features a controversial new soundtrack based on underground Detroit techno. The US version was severely neutered with an altered story, removed content, and baffling color-swaps so this page will focus on Bare Knuckle III, the original Japanese release.\n",
    "trivia": "Sega of America butchered Bare Knuckle III into Streets of Rage 3 in a handful of ways. First, they color-swapped the characters (and did an amateur job) which makes the sprites pop out less. Secondly, they changed the story and removed the bombing subplot. They also removed Ash, the gay stereotype character, which is somewhat understandable. Additionally, they made Streets of Rage 3 way, way harder and reduced the number of difficulty settings by 1. So, at least Streets 3 is appealing to truly experts Streets players because it offers the greatest challenge in the series.A large part of the soundtrack was generated by randomized beat generation software, apparently. Also, Yuzo did not directly compose most of the music and instead handed the reigns to his protege, Motohiro Kawashima.Yuzo recorded all the voices for Bare Knuckle III, but Sega of America used different actors for each character when they re-dubbed Streets 3.There are four endings: first, if you play on easy, the game will end immediately after defeating Robo X with a cutscene telling you to try harder. Second, if you fail to save the guy at the end of stage 6, you'll go to stage 7B and fight Shiva while Mr. X looks on from a far-off room. Third, if you reach Neo X and die, a bomb goes off and you get the bad ending. Finally, if you beat Neo X in time, you'll get the good ending.Max and Adam from the previous games appear in the credits.Streets of Rage 3 is available on Genesis, Steam, PSN and Xbox Live.Otohime and Yasha's team-based projectile attack is actually a fat man riding a horse.Axel's headband-tying intro scene in Bare Knuckle III is a rip-off of the same scene from Rambo III.Every time you get 40,000 points without dying, you gain a star. If you die, you lose a star and your point counter is reset (meaning if you die with 50,000 points, you need to get 90,000 points for another star.) Stars permanently upgrade your dash-attack. You can also execute your star moves with cheater combos using the X button on the Genesis 6-button controller. See the Fighters tab for more info.The beta version featured motorcycle segments where a Donovan on the back of a truck would throw barrels at you while bikers ride by and toss grenades. This was cut before the final release but was restored in Streets of Rage Remake. ",

    "overallReview": "Streets of Rage III is a great conclusion to Sega's legendary trilogy. The additions to the combat, especially the energy bar, significantly improve the gameplay without completely reinventing it. The character sprites are better than ever, but the stage design is fairly bland. The music isn't awful, but it's definitely an acquired taste.",

    "trivia": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an adaptation of the 1987 cartoon series of the same name. Although the comic series came before, it lacked most of the iconic characters like Rocksteady, Bebop, Baxter Stockman, and Krang.Throws in this game don't work like any other brawler. Basically you get a free throw when you defeat an enemy. See the Fighters section for more info.In Europe, TMNT are known as the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles. Due to the fact that the holocaust happened there, Europe (and especially Germany) has far harsher censorship than the US. The term \"Ninja\" was deemed too violent so it was changed to \"Hero\" instead.This is the only TMNT game where you fight Baxter Stockman in his human form. In all other titles, you fight him after he's mutated into a fly-man.",

    "overallReview": "Playing this crippled version of the original is weird. It's definitely palatable, because hey, it's Final Fight with guns. But the graphics, sound, and polish are way below Capcom standards (it's a Genesis game after all). It's alright if you're starving for something other than Streets of Rage but you might as well just play the original.",

You play as a trio of dwarves who escaped a Dungeons and Dragons game and must fight their way through the real world to save a group of genius children. Its unique combat engine has a ton of moves and is very projectile-heavy. You can freely switch between the three dwarves at any time, and they have completely unique attacks. Also, each dwarf counts as a hitpoint that can be regained by attacking him when he's down.\n",
    "trivia": "This game is similar to Guardian Heroes in that it's a cartoony, innovative brawler for the Saturn.This is the only brawler with the unique \"1 character = 1 hitpoint\" system.",

It features simple yet challenging gameplay, bizarre enemy design, phenomenal audiovisual presentation, and a one-of-a-kind personality. It introduced the concept of ultimate attacks, which are basically death-blows on steroids. It also has a unique \"Finess Trick\" system that rewards using advanced techniques.\n",
    "trivia": "Undercover Cops is basically an alternate version of Final Fight. Zan is Guy, Rosa is Cody, and Matt is Haggar. Dr. Crayton, like Belger, is a short, cheating bad guy who has an easy first form followed by a hard second. And both games are about a city overrun by crime that has to be cleaned up by three vigilantes.The US port of Undercover Cops is one of the worst cases of executive meddling in any brawler, perhaps even worse than Streets of Rage III. They renamed the characters and changed their backstories, removed about half the attacks, took out or changed several pieces of background art, and removed the voice samples from the music. There existed an Alpha version at some point that didn't have these issues, and there's even an Alpha Renewal kit that restored the normal version to its former glory, although both of these are ridiculously rare.Undercover Cops has a board game RPG (similar to Sugoro Quest) spin-off on the Game Boy called Undercover Cops Hakaishin Garumaa. It's barely playable if you don't speak Japanese although the characters are the only thing that makes it an \"Undercover Cops\" game.One of the items in this game is R-Type. R-Type is Irem's most successful franchise by far. It's a hard-as-nails space shooter with an H.R. Giger art style.",

Like Crime Fighters before it, several elements were removed in the US release. Most notably, the gay stereotype and humping dog enemies have been completely cut.",

Unfortunately, its gameplay doesn't do the presentation justice as it's an extremely simplistic and easy brawler. Interestingly, there are throws although weaker characters can't throw heavier enemies. That being said, there's a cool stage select setup and decent variety.",

    "overallReview": "Zero Team is awesome. The distinct characters and dynamic combos make the combat a lot of fun. Although the sprites are fairly small, they're detailed and the color usage is off the chain. The backgrounds look especially excellent. Unfortunately, the music is just awful. It could also be a little harder and longer.",

    "about": "\n\nZoku: The Legend of Bishin is a Super Famicom exclusive brawler/racer hybrid. It mainly features Mode 7 racing where you must rush to the target and beat the time limit. When you crash your car, you get thrown from it and the game turns into a brawler. Bosses are also fought with traditional beat 'em up combat.\n",
    "trivia": "There are secret codes that let you change the color of your car.This game features one of the worst cases of rubber-band AI ever: enemies will be slow until you pass them, at which point they're way faster than you and hit you in the butt. Try to drive safely behind most enemies because out-pacing them is rarely worth it.",

    "overallReview": "Zoku: The Legend of Bishin is just awful. It fails completely as a racing game, which is unfortunately what you do most of the time. As a brawler, it's just passable and shallower than a half-filled kiddy pool. This could have been a groundbreaking game, but it's little more than a tech demo for two disparate yet completely unfinished games.",
